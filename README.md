## Installation Instructions 

1) Ensure Qgis 3.10.3-A CoruÃ±a LTR is installed and working on your system ([Qgis download page](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html)) with all the required python packages [requirements](https://github.com/IBIGroupCanWest/CanFlood/tree/master/requirements). We recommend this be done by a user with administrative privileges and using the OSGeo4W installer (using the 'advanced install' option described [here](https://github.com/IBIGroupCanWest/CanFlood/issues/6#issuecomment-592091488)) to better manage versions and dependnecies.  In particular, 'pandas' doesn't seem to be installed by default with some distributions.  But hopefully you get lucky and your install comes with everything!

2) In Qgis, install the plugin 'First Aid' from the plugin repository (https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/firstaid/). This plugin provides additional support for viewing errors in other plugins (essential for communicating your crash reports back to the develpoment team).

3) Download the latest Plugin zip from the above [plugin_zips folder](https://github.com/IBIGroupCanWest/CanFlood/tree/master/plugin_zips) to your computer: click the link (e.g. 'CanFlood_020_20200403.zip'), select 'Download'.

4) In Qgis, install the plugin to your profile from this zip  (Plugins > Manage and Install... > Install from Zip > navigate to the .zip > Install Plugin)

5) In Qgis, Turn the plugin on (Plugins > Manage and Install ... > Installed > check 'CanFlood'). If a dependency error is thrown, see 'troubleshooting' below.  If successful, you should see the three CanFlood buttons on your toolbar.

6) Ensure the plugin 'Processing' is similarly activated

### Troubleshooting Installation.

As Qgis is a very active open source project, getting your installation congirured approriately for CanFlood can be challenging... especially if you lack admin privileges to your machine. Some installations of QGIS may not come pre-installed with all the required python packages and dependencies listed in the [requirements](https://github.com/IBIGroupCanWest/CanFlood/tree/master/requirements) file.  If you get a ModuleNotFound error, your Qgis install does not have the required packages. This can be easily remedied by a user with admin privileges and working pyqgis knowledge.  The following [solution](https://github.com/IBIGroupCanWest/CanFlood/issues/6#issuecomment-592091488) provides some guidance on installing third party python modules, but you'll likely need admin privilege. 


## Getting Started

Read the latest users manual from the  '[manuals folder](https://github.com/IBIGroupCanWest/CanFlood/tree/master/manual)' and work through the tutorials.

If there is no issue ticket yet, create a new one on the above '[Issues](https://github.com/IBIGroupCanWest/CanFlood/issues)' tab with a screen shot of the error (and output from the QGIS plugin 'First Aid' if possible).
