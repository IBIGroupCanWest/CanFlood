## Installation Instructions 

1) ensure Qgis 3.10.3-A CoruÃ±a LTR is installed and working on your system [link](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) with all the required python packages [requirements](https://github.com/IBIGroupCanWest/CanFlood/tree/master/requirements). We recommend using the OSGeo4W installer (selecting 'advanced install') to better manage versions and dependnecies (in particular, 'pandas' doesn't seem to be installed by default with some distributions).

2) In Qgis, install the plugin 'First Aid' from the plugin repository (https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/firstaid/). This plugin provides additional support for viewing errors in other plugins (essential for communicating your crash reports back to the develpoment team).

3) Download the latest Plugin zip from the above [plugin_zips folder](https://github.com/IBIGroupCanWest/CanFlood/tree/master/plugin_zips) to your computer (Right Click...> Save As).

4) In Qgis, install the plugin to your profile from this zip  (Plugins > Manage and Install... > Install from Zip > navigate to the .zip > Install Plugin)

5) In Qgis, Turn the plugin on (Plugins > Manage and Install ... > Installed > check 'CanFlood'. If a dependency error is thrown, see 'troubleshooting' below.  If successful, you should see the three CanFlood buttons on your toolbar.

6) Ensure the plugin 'Processing' is similarly activated

### Troubleshooting Installation.

Some installations of QGIS may not come pre-installed with all the required python packages and dependencies listed in the [requirements](https://github.com/IBIGroupCanWest/CanFlood/tree/master/requirements) file. If you get a ModuleNotFound error, see the following [solution](https://github.com/IBIGroupCanWest/CanFlood/issues/6#issuecomment-592091488) with screenshots with guidance on installing third party python modules to your Qgis  build.


## Getting Started
